Project Title:BUILDING WITH RESPONSIVE DESIGN

In this project,  we'll be buildinga responsive website by cloning The Next Web, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.
we'll be trying to improve  much faster at setting up a site layout and positioning the elements than when we started.
we'll use both html and css to workout all the entire project. we'll be exploring our pages and how they're grouped,discovering all breakpoints where element properties change,etc.
Laying out the basic structure of the page using empty semantic HTML elements that are appropriately sized and positioned,will also be an experience to explore by the end of this project.

BUILT WITH:
*HTML
*CSS
