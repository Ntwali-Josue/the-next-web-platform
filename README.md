# The Next Web Platform

In this project,  we'll be building a responsive website by cloning The Next Web, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.

We'll be trying to improve  much faster at setting up a site layout and positioning the elements than ever happened before.

We'll use both html and css to workout all the entire project.  we'll be exploring how our pages will be grouped, and discovere all breakpoints where element properties change,etc.

Laying out the basic structure of the page using empty semantic HTML elements that are appropriately sized and positioned,will also be an experience to explore by the end of this project.

# Built with:
